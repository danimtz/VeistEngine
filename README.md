# VeistEngine
Veist is a vulkan rendering engine written with the objective of learning how the basics of the graphics API and game engines.  
Currently a work in progress, it has several features already such as a working proof of concept editor, a rendergraph system to easily setup the rendering
architecture and automatically handle and manage device resources. Simple deferred and forward rendering have been implemented, with clustered/forward+ to be implemented soon on the renderer side. The engine and editor themselves are also a work in progress.

## Current features:
### Engine:
- Spir-V reflection of glsl shader to create descriptor set layouts.
- Command buffer recording abstraction.
- Free camera movement using quaternions.
- GLTF2.0 model loading
- Uses GLFW for window mangement
- ImGUI based dditor built as a separate program
- Entity component system
- Movable transform components
- RenderGraph rendering system (Allows renderer architecture to be swapped mid program from deferred to forward)

### Renderer:
- Deferred fenderer
- Forward renderer
- Double buffering
- Directional and Point lights
- Physically Based Rendering (Cook Torrance BRDF)
- Image-Based Lighting (calculates diffuse irradince maps, BRDF LUTs and pre-filtered environment map using compute shaders)
- Cubemapped skybox
- ShadowMapping

## Download:
Although the project is fully for educational purposes feel free to download it if you so want. I cant guarantee it will fully function. Once cloned, cmake can be used to build the project however a few errors might show up:
- Make sure to "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" to initialize a few of the libraries.
- In Cmake untick SPIRV_CROSS_ENABLE_TEST if it is enabled.
- If the project gives errors when running about missing shader files, the working directory of the Editor project might be one directory out. It should be in VeistEngine/bin/XXXXX(Debug, Release etc...).
